# Blockchain

The IoTeX blockchain is decentralized, EVM-compatible, and lightning-fast, making it the perfect foundation for decentralized applications and products. Powered by our in-house [Roll-DPoS consensus mechanism](https://res.cloudinary.com/dokc3pa1x/image/upload/v1559623484/Research%20Paper/Academic_Paper_Yellow_Paper.pdf), the IoTeX blockchain is governed and maintained by 60+ [Delegates](https://member.iotex.io/) for true decentralization. As the "root of trust" for the entire IoTeX Network, our blockchain is fully [open-source](https://github.com/iotexproject) and built-from-scratch to the highest technical standards. It is also one of the fastest blockchains in the industry \(5-second blocks w/ instant finality\) and has been running error-free since 2019.

The IoTeX blockchain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EVM\), which allows developers to build/convert any Solidity-based smart contract on IoTeX. In June 2020, IoTeX launched [Mainnet GA "Machina"](https://medium.com/iotex/the-iotex-platform-optimized-for-the-internet-of-trusted-things-dd4f9240db59), our fully native blockchain that incorporates native staking \([nsv2](https://medium.com/@iotex/iotex-native-staking-v2-a-new-scalable-secure-and-flexible-design-31d709c2b20e)\) and powered by the native IOTX token. In January 2021, the IoTeX blockchain surpassed 10 million transactions and now processes thousands of transactions every day.

The IoTeX blockchain utilizes Roll-DPoS consensus, a variant of Delegated Proof of Stake \(DPoS\) designed in-house to support the high scalability required for IoT use cases. Unlike traditional DPoS that utilizes a fixed number of Delegates \(e.g., EOS has 21 block producers\), Roll-DPoS randomly selects 24 of the top 36 community-voted Delegates to mine every hour, which greatly improves the decentralization and security of the IoTeX Network without sacrificing performance.
