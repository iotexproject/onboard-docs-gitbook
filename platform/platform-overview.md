# Platform Overview

The IoTeX platform was built 100% from scratch \(no forks!\) to support large-scale, decentralized IoT use cases. IoTeX is more than just a blockchain -- it is a full-stack platform to enable **trusted data** from **trusted devices** for use in **trusted DApps**. The IoTeX platform was architected by an award-winning team of cryptographers and research scientists that currently lead the world's premier technology and standards consortiums, including the [IIC](https://medium.com/iotex/iotex-amazon-and-huawei-selected-as-co-chairs-of-the-iic-blockchain-task-group-9032b7b7443f#:~:text=IoTeX%20has%20been%20selected%20as,%2C%20and%20Mike%20McBride%2C%20Sr.), [IEEE](https://medium.com/iotex/iotex-publishes-ieee-reports-on-blockchain-iot-c6650c26f443), and [CCC](https://www.coindesk.com/facebook-iotex-and-r3-among-new-members-of-confidential-computing-consortium).

Although architecturally similar to Ethereum, IoTeX is not an "Ethereum killer". ****Rather, IoTeX will be the hub for decentralized IoT data/devices and collaborate with Ethereum and other Layer 1 platforms. The IoTeX platform employs a modular architecture consisting of various technological layers:

* **Blockchain:** EVM-compatible, Roll-DPoS consensus \(5 sec blocks + instant finality\), maintained by 60+ decentralized Delegates
* **Decentralized Identity \(DID\):** on-chain identity framework that enables users/devices to own their data, identity, and credentials
* **Real World Data Oracles:** convert real world phenomena into verifiable, blockchain-ready data for use in IoTeX DApps
* **Secure Hardware:** tamper-proof devices utilizing Trusted Execution Environment \(TEE\) that integrate seamlessly with IoTeX

We detail each component of the IoTeX platform in the following sections.
