# Decentralized Identity (DID)

Decentralized Identity (DID) is a core component of the IoTeX platform, serving as the "root of self-sovereignty" for the entire network. Unlike other blockchain platforms that focus on DID for only people, IoTeX has developed a unique DID system for both people and devices. This means people and devices can transact directly with each other via IoTeX, as their identities are interoperable and standardized across the platform. Furthermore, IoTeX DID empowers users and devices to own/control their data and identity, and utilize them across the IoTeX network.

IoTeX's DID technology and accompanying Identity & Access Management (IAM) framework are now being standardized in enterprise technology consortiums, including the [Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC)](https://www.iiconsortium.org/pdf/IIC-Edge-DID-Tech-Brief.pdf). For global-scale IoT ecosystems that include diverse manufacturers, billions of IoT devices, and millions of users, IoTeX's DID + IAM framework can connect heterogeneous application silos and facilitate user-centric data sharing in a decentralized manner.
