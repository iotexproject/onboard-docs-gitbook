# Working Group

IoTeX is a digital democracy where the voice of the community is the driver of change. The fact that any stakeholder can propose, debate, and vote for changes is a core principle embedded in our governance design. In the future, all IoTeX stakeholders will have the ability to evangelize and implement their ideas without requiring permission from the IoTeX Foundation or anyone else â€” a truly open ecosystem where the best ideas win! Transitioning from a Foundation-led to a community-owned network will remove any single points of failure and allow IoTeX to evolve safely, rapidly, and collectively.
