# Staking & Voting

A core part of decentralized governance in the IoTeX Network is staking, where token-holders deposit \(“stake”\) IOTX to generate voting power, which they can use to participate in network governance. IoTeX utilizes [Roll-DPoS consensus](https://res.cloudinary.com/dokc3pa1x/image/upload/v1559623484/Research%20Paper/Academic_Paper_Yellow_Paper.pdf), where community-voted Delegates manage consensus on behalf of the entire network. Any token-holder that stakes IOTX can vote for one or more Delegates. By staking/voting, token-holders not only enhance the overall security of the IoTeX Network but also earn up to 10% annualized interest on their staked IOTX.

To participate in the voting process, IoTeX token-holders stake IOTX tokens and receive one vote for every IOTX staked \(1 IOTX = 1 vote\). Those that show long-term commitment by setting a predefined [stake duration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hw3o3PVohR4E5XFjkX3pQvEc6APdO1pB/view?usp=sharing) will be rewarded with “bonus votes” that increase the staking rewards received. In addition to stake duration, there are several parameters a voter will choose when creating a new vote:

* **Delegate:** there are [60+ Delegates](http://member.iotex.io/) that contribute differently to IoTeX and pay different amounts of rewards to voters. You can switch your vote to another Delegate at any time.
* **Amount:** the \# of IOTX you wish to stake/vote. You can add IOTX to an existing bucket after your initial vote \(must have the stake lock ON\).
* **Stake Duration:** the amount of time you wish to stake your tokens \(between 0-1050 days\). The longer you stake, the more bonus votes/rewards you get.
* **Stake Lock:** by turning the stake lock ON, you will receive even more bonus votes/rewards _\(i.e., 14 days w/ stake lock ON gets the same \# of bonus votes as 28 days + stake lock OFF\)_ but your stake duration will be “paused” until you turn off stake lock. After you turn the stake lock OFF, you will lose your bonus votes/rewards, and your stake duration will resume counting down to zero.

**IMPORTANT:** you will NOT be able to un-stake your tokens until your stake duration expires. The un-staking process lasts 3 days, after which you may withdraw your tokens to your wallet.
