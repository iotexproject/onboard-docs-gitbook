# Delegates Program

IoTeX is a decentralized and permissionless network – anyone may register to become a block-producing Delegate at any time. The IoTeX Network utilizes Roll-DPoS consensus, where 24 of the top 36 community-voted Delegates are randomly selected to mine blocks every hour. For their services, Delegates are rewarded with IOTX tokens, which they often share with their voters.

IoTeX是一个去中心化的、无需许可的网络，这意味着任何人都可以申请成为节点并参与区块生产。IoTeX网络采用Roll-DPoS共识机制，在投票排名前36的节点中，每小时随机选择24个节点来生产区块。节点会收到IOTX通证作为回报，同时用这些通证奖励给支持他的投票人。

To be eligible to mine blocks, all Delegates must meet the minimum requirements, including self-staking at least 1.2 million IOTX, receiving at least 2 million total votes, and maintaining a server to prevent any node downtime. The annual hardware costs to operate a Delegate node is extremely affordable at ≤$600 per year.

节点必须满足一定要求才有资格参与生产区块，包括至少持有120万IOTX、至少获得200万总投票、维护服务器以防止其他节点宕机。运行节点的硬件成本非常低廉，每年只需不到600美元。
