# Burn-Drop

Burn-Drop is an innovative tokenomics design where **1 Billion IOTX \(10% of total supply\) will be burned + dropped**  as we onboard the first 1 million “Powered by IoTeX” devices. Of the 1 Billion IOTX allocated to Burn-Drop, 900M \(90%\) will be burned and 100M \(10%\) will be dropped to long-term stakers. This also means the **total supply of IOTX will decrease for every newly registered device**. Burn-Drop will bring new value to the IoTeX Network in various ways, including:

* Support device builders by covering certification costs
* Incentivize users to adopt “Powered by IoTeX” devices
* Encourage all entities to evangelize IoTeX technology
* Reward long-term stakers and drive value to IOTX coin

Burn-Drop will be facilitated by smart contract and a new Burn-Drop event will be automatically triggered on a daily basis. ****Burn-Drop will have a total of ten phases with earlier phases having a higher Burn-Drop rate. In Phase 1 \(i.e., the first 1,000 devices\), a total of 100,000 IOTX will be Burn-Dropped for every new device. In subsequent phases, the Burn-Drop rate will be halved while the number of devices-per-phase will be doubled \(i.e., Phase 2 = 2,000 devices @ 50,000 IOTX per device\).

After 1 million “Powered by IoTeX” devices are onboarded, Burn-Drop will be finished and “Burn-to-Certify” tokenomics will be activated. From then on, builders \(e.g., device manufacturers\) will burn IOTX to obtain access to special services/capabilities for each new device. This will continue in perpetuity and the **total supply of IOTX will decrease with every new “Powered by IoTeX” device**, as shown in the graph below.
