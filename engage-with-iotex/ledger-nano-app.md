IoTeX is an EVM compatible, Smart Contract platform therefore it supports “Layer 2” tokens defined as smart contracts. IoTeX defines token standards fully equivalent to those available on Ethereum: XRC20 and XRC721 token standards on IoTeX play the role of ERC20 and ERC721 standards on Ethereum. If you own any XRC20 token in your Ledger Nano account, you can check its balance in ioPay as well: just click the “Add Token” button to select the XRC20 token you are interested in \(or input the token contract address if you know it\) and the balance will be permanently added in the XRC20 tokens panel:
