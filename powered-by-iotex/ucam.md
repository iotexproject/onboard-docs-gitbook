[Ucam](https://ucam.iotex.io) is the worldâ€™s first home security camera with 100% privacy and user data ownership, powered by the IoTeX platform. Ucam received the **CES Innovation Award for Cybersecurity & Personal Privacy** and has sold thousands of units on Amazon and global retailers. Ucam uses decentralized identity and end-to-end encryption to ensure nobody can access your device or videos except you -- not even our engineers can view your videos for any reason! Ucam was built in partnership with [Tenvis](https://iotex.medium.com/iotex-partners-with-hardware-giant-tenvis-for-fully-private-ip-cameras-9dbfbd923128), a global security camera enterprise since 2005.

Ucam replaces traditional password-based login with blockchain-based login -- unlike an 8-character password that can be cracked in minutes, a blockchain private key is uncrackable and owned exclusively by you. Ucam uses the user's private key to end-to-end encrypt all videos, so the only place your videos can be decrypted is on your mobile device. Ucam offers 1080p HD livestream, Cloud/MicroSD storage, motion detection alerts, night vision, two-way audio, and in-app pan/tilt/zoom features. All the features you want, with the big feature you need: **100% privacy.**
