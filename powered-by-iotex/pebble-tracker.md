# Pebble Tracker

[Pebble Tracker](https://iotex.io/pebble) is a first-of-its-kind Blockchain + IoT dev-board that was built in partnership with [Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com/News/2020/02/IoTeXs-Cellular-IoT-based-tracker-delivers-environmental-and-condition-data-for-assets-in-transit), a global IoT enterprise. Equipped with a TEE and multiple sensors \(GPS, climate, motion, light\), Pebble Tracker captures/signs data from the real world and converts it into verifiable, blockchain-ready data. This verifiably trustworthy data can be used to mint digital assets, trigger actions via smart contracts, train machine learning models, create crowdsourced indices, and more.

A system is only as secure as its weakest link. Our motivation for building Pebble Tracker was to combine tamper-proof hardware \(TEE\) and tamper-proof software \(blockchain\) to redefine _who, what, and why we trust_. By pairing the integrity of secure hardware with the immutability of blockchain, IoTeX is establishing a new paradigm for end-to-end trust. We began building Pebble Tracker v1 in 2020 and made several iterations to the hardware/firmware for Pebble Tracker v2, which is now available for sale on [CrowdSupply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/iotex/pebble-tracker).

Pebble Tracker captures/signs a variety of real-world data \(GPS location, temperature, humidity, air quality, air pressure, motion, light\) that can be verified and therefore trusted, by anyone. Pebble does this by capturing and cryptographically signing real-world data using a built-in secure element, similar to the chips in your smartphone to manage FaceID/fingerprints and crypto hardware wallets to manage private keys. This signed data is hashed to the blockchain for provenance, almost like an “on-chain birth certificate”, which allows anyone to verify its authenticity. It’s an entirely new standard for trust — _trusted data from trusted devices to feed trusted applications._
